 # Customer-Segmentation-Using-Clustering

This project focuses on performing Customer Segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means Clustering, to identify distinct groups of customers based on their behaviors and attributes. This approach is widely used in marketing analytics to personalize customer experiences and improve business strategies.

### Project Objective

To analyze customer data and group individuals into meaningful segments based on their annual income and spending behavior. These insights can help businesses:

•	Develop targeted marketing strategies

•	Enhance customer engagement

•	Increase conversion rates

•	Identify potential growth opportunities

### Methodology

**1.Data Preprocessing**

   •	Handling missing values
  
   •	Data formatting and exploration

**2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

  •	Distribution plots
  •	Correlation heatmaps
  •	Cluster-wise visualizations

**3.Feature Scaling**

 •	StandardScaler to normalize features

**4.Clustering**

  •	K-Means algorithm
  •	Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine optimal cluster count

**5.Visualization**

  •	2D and 3D cluster plots using PCA for dimensionality reduction

### Key Insights

 •	Identified 5 unique customer segments with varied income and spending behaviors.

 •	Discovered a segment of low-income but high-spending customers—ideal for promotional targeting.

 •	Found high-income but low-spending individuals—potentially underserved customers.

 •	These segments help design personalized marketing strategies and improve customer lifetime value (CLV).
